In the original wav file, the audio is clear and you can hear a woman speaking clearly.
However, in the reconstructed wav file, the audio is garbled and although you can make out
the same pattern of speech as in the original, the words are unclear.

The reason for this is because the reconstructed wav file has undergone an FIR filter.

In the original audio spectrogram, all the frequencies from the irregularities of the speech are 
clearly represented.
Whereas in the reconstructed audio spectrogram, some of the frequencies are not plotted out because
the aforementioned filter has been applied.
