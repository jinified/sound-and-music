The performance of the J48 algorithm on both buffer-based and whole-song ARFF files is much better than the Decision Tree.
However, both algorithms on the buffer-based produce better results than on the whole-song ARFF, as they correctly classified more than 90% of all files.
The best result among the four belongs to trees.J48 on the buffer-based ARFF file.
